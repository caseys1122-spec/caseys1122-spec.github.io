      <p>I am an undergrad student at the University of Kentucky seeking an eventual doctorate in Linguistics! My interests are in historical linguistics, phonology, and sociolinguistics, among others. Below are main specialties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I am most interested in historical linguistics and phonology... I particularly love proto-language reconstruction!</li>
        <li>I focus primarily on the Mande languages and Niger-Congo languages, as well as Arawakan, Muskogean, and Natchez languages of the Americas.</li>
        <li>I'm involved in research surrounding the Mande languages and their potential external relationships, the extinct Taino language, and the classification of Natchez. I also dabble in conlanging!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="tagline">My Journey</h2>
      <p>I went to high school in Nashville, Tennessee at the private Father Ryan High School. Currently, I'm enrolled as a senior undergrad at UK, and plan to earn my doctorate in linguistics here at UK.</p>

    <section id="project">
      <h2 class="tagline">My Current Projects</h2>
      <p>My latest research has been on the Mande languages, a language family of West Africa, but I also love researching Indigenous languages. Some examples of my projects include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An evaluation of the relationship between the Mande languages and the Atlantic-Congo languages</li>
        <li>An in-progress reconstruction of the Proto-Mande language, specifically its phonology</li>
        <li>A comparative analysis of Natchez with several Muskogean languages</li>
        <li>A historical analysis of the Taino language and other Ta-Arawakan languages</li>
      </ul>
